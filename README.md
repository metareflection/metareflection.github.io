# [metareflection](https://github.com/metareflection).club

The [metareflection.club](https://metareflection.club) researches all aspects of static and dynamic reflection, programs / processes manipulating programs / processes.

## Research Projects

- Theory of effectful multi-stage programming
- Theory (semantics) and practice (architectures, examples) of dynamic reflection
- Applications of computational reflection to learning theories in cognitive science and psychology
- Neuro-symbolic bijections
- Modular verification
- Synthesizing synthesis
- Joining relational programming and SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving
- Unifying probabilistic and constraint/logic programming
- Automating (chip) design
- Automating (biology) protocols
